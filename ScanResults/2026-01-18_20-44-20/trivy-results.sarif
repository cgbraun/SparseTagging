                "text": "### Summary\nThere is a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in the jaraco.context package affecting setuptools as well, in `jaraco.context.tarball()` function. The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed.\nThe strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`.\nNote that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`.\n\nThe code can be found:\n- https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91\n- https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76 (inherited)\n\nThis report was also sent to setuptools maintainers and they asked some questions regarding this.\n\nThe lengthy answer is:\n\nThe vulnerability seems to be the `strip_first_component` filter function, not the tarball function itself and has the same behavior on any tested Python version locally (from 11 to 14, as I noticed that there is a backports conditional for the tarball).\nThe stock tarball for Python 3.12+ is considered not vulnerable (until proven otherwise 😄) but here the custom filter seems to overwrite the native filtering and introduces the issue - while overwriting the updated secure Python 3.12+ behavior and giving a false sense of sanitization.\n\nThe short answer is:\n\nIf we are talking about Python \u0026lt; 3.12 the tarball and jaraco implementations /  behaviors are relatively the same but for Python 3.12+ the jaraco implementation overwrites the native tarball protection.\n\nSampled tests:\n\u0026lt;img width=\u0026#34;1634\u0026#34;

The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed.\nThe strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`.\nNote that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`.\n\nThe code can be found:\n- https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91\n- https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76 (inherited)\n\nThis report was also sent to setuptools maintainers and they asked some questions regarding this.\n\nThe lengthy answer is:\n\nThe vulnerability seems to be the `strip_first_component` filter function, not the tarball function itself and has the same behavior on any tested Python version locally (from 11 to 14, as I noticed that there is a backports conditional for the tarball).\nThe stock tarball for Python 3.12+ is considered not vulnerable (until proven otherwise 😄) but here the custom filter seems to overwrite the native filtering and introduces the issue - while overwriting the updated secure Python 3.12+ behavior and giving a false sense of sanitization.\n\nThe short answer is:\n\nIf we are talking about Python \u003c 3.12 the tarball and jaraco implementations /  behaviors are relatively the same but for Python 3.12+ the jaraco implementation overwrites the native tarball protection.\n\nSampled tests:\n\u003cimg width=\"1634\" height=\"245\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce6c0de6-bb53-4c2b-818a-d77e28d2fbeb\" /\u003e\n\n### Details\n\nThe flow with setuptools in the mix:\n```\nsetuptools._vendor.jaraco.context.tarball() \u003e req = urlopen(url) \u003e with tarfile.open(fileobj=req, mode='r|*') as tf: \u003e tf.extractall(path=target_dir, filter=strip_first_component) \u003e strip_first_component (Vulnerable)\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nThis was tested on multiple Python versions \u003e 11 on a Debian GNU 12 (bookworm).\nYou can run this directly after having all the dependencies:\n```py\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport tarfile\nimport io\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport shutil\nimport tempfile\nfrom setuptools._vendor.jaraco.context import strip_first_component\n\n\ndef create_malicious_tarball():\n    tar_data = io.BytesIO()\n    with tarfile.open(fileobj=tar_data, mode='w') as tar:\n        #

The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed.\nThe strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`.\nNote that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`.\n\nThe code can be found:\n- https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.context/blob/main/jaraco/context/__init__.py#L74-L91\n- https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/setuptools/_vendor/jaraco/context.py#L55-L76 (inherited)\n\nThis report was also sent to setuptools maintainers and they asked some questions regarding this.\n\nThe lengthy answer is:\n\nThe vulnerability seems to be the `strip_first_component` filter function, not the tarball function itself and has the same behavior on any tested Python version locally (from 11 to 14, as I noticed that there is a backports conditional for the tarball).\nThe stock tarball for Python 3.12+ is considered not vulnerable (until proven otherwise 😄) but here the custom filter seems to overwrite the native filtering and introduces the issue - while overwriting the updated secure Python 3.12+ behavior and giving a false sense of sanitization.\n\nThe short answer is:\n\nIf we are talking about Python \u003c 3.12 the tarball and jaraco implementations /  behaviors are relatively the same but for Python 3.12+ the jaraco implementation overwrites the native tarball protection.\n\nSampled tests:\n\u003cimg width=\"1634\" height=\"245\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce6c0de6-bb53-4c2b-818a-d77e28d2fbeb\" /\u003e\n\n### Details\n\nThe flow with setuptools in the mix:\n```\nsetuptools._vendor.jaraco.context.tarball() \u003e req = urlopen(url) \u003e with tarfile.open(fileobj=req, mode='r|*') as tf: \u003e tf.extractall(path=target_dir, filter=strip_first_component) \u003e strip_first_component (Vulnerable)\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nThis was tested on multiple Python versions \u003e 11 on a Debian GNU 12 (bookworm).\nYou can run this directly after having all the dependencies:\n```py\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport tarfile\nimport io\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport shutil\nimport tempfile\nfrom setuptools._vendor.jaraco.context import strip_first_component\n\n\ndef create_malicious_tarball():\n    tar_data = io.BytesIO()\n    with tarfile.open(fileobj=tar_data, mode='w') as tar:\n        #
