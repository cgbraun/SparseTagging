Perfect! I've created a complete, actionable implementation plan for your Claude Code templates system. Here's what you're getting:
📦 Your Deliverables
1. PROJECT_SUMMARY.md - Start Here
Your roadmap document. Read this first (10 minutes) to understand:

What problem this solves
What you'll build
How to use it with Claude Code in PyCharm
Success metrics and next steps

2. QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md - Keep Open While Working
Action-oriented cheat sheet with:

Copy-paste prompts for each phase
Validation commands
Troubleshooting guide
Expected outputs for each step

3. CLAUDE_CODE_TEMPLATES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Complete Specification
The full technical plan (30 pages) with:

Detailed architecture and file structures
All template content with placeholders
Placeholder replacement engine specs
Validation criteria
Phase-by-phase implementation guide

🎯 What This Enables
In 2.5 hours of implementation, you'll have:

Interactive script: init_project.py
Templates for Python libraries, CLIs, and services
Defense-grade quality standards embedded
Your SparseTag lessons codified and reusable

After implementation, new projects take <5 minutes:
bashpython init_project.py
# Follow prompts → Fully configured defense-grade project
```

Every new project gets:
- ✅ 85%+ test coverage requirements
- ✅ Mypy strict mode type checking
- ✅ SonarCloud integration
- ✅ CVE scanning (Dependabot + pip-audit)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Comprehensive CI/CD
- ✅ Claude Code optimized CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Defense-grade permissions model

## 🚀 How to Use This

### In PyCharm with Claude Code:

1. **Open PyCharm**, create directory: `claude-code-templates/`
2. **Start Claude Code**: `claude` in terminal
3. **Open QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md** for prompts
4. **Give Claude Code the Phase 1 prompt** (copy from guide)
5. **Follow the phase-by-phase prompts** (5 phases total)
6. **Test with real project names** (not "test123")
7. **Use for your next 2-3 MRSL projects**

### The First Prompt to Claude Code:
```
I'm implementing a Claude Code project templates system for defense-grade Python projects.

Read CLAUDE_CODE_TEMPLATES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for complete specifications.

Start with Phase 1 only:
1. Create directory structure: templates/, examples/, scripts/
2. Create QUALITY_STANDARDS.md based on defense contractor requirements
3. Create basic README.md
4. Set up examples/reference-sparsetag/ with my uploaded files

Show me the structure before proceeding.
💡 Key Design Decisions
Based on your inputs:

Defense-Grade Only: All templates enforce 85% coverage, complexity ≤15, strict mypy
Permissive Reads, Restrictive Writes: Can explore freely, but no accidental git push
Three Project Types: Library (primary), CLI, Web Service
Interactive Script: Asks questions, validates, creates complete project
SparseTag Patterns: Generalized from your proven real-world experience

📊 Expected Timeline

Phase 1 (Foundation): 15 minutes
Phase 2 (Library Template): 30 minutes
Phase 3 (Interactive Script): 45 minutes
Phase 4 (Testing): 30 minutes
Phase 5 (Documentation): 20 minutes

Total: ~2.5 hours to complete implementation
Then test on 2-3 real projects to refine.
